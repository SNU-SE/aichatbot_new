- **Passed**: 264 tests (70.2%)
- **Failed**: 78 tests (20.7%)
- **Skipped**: 34 tests (9.1%)

### Test Categories Performance
1. **Unit Tests**: ✅ Core functionality working
2. **Integration Tests**: ⚠️ Some API endpoint issues
3. **Performance Tests**: ✅ Meeting benchmarks
4. **Security Tests**: ✅ Security measures functional

### Key Test Issues Identified
1. **Router Conflicts**: Multiple BrowserRouter instances in test environment
2. **Performance API**: Missing browser APIs in test environment
3. **Memory Usage**: Some tests hitting memory limits
4. **Environment Dependencies**: Missing test environment setup

## Security Assessment

### Security Advisors (Supabase)
- **Security Issues**: 31 warnings (function search_path mutable)
- **Severity**: WARN level - non-critical security recommendations
- **Impact**: Minimal - related to database function security best practices
- **Action**: Can be addressed post-deployment

### Performance Advisors (Supabase)
- **Performance Issues**: 85+ recommendations
- **Main Issues**: 
  - Unindexed foreign keys (3 instances)
  - Auth RLS initialization plans (40+ instances)
  - Unused indexes (60+ instances)
  - Multiple permissive policies (8 instances)
- **Impact**: Performance optimization opportunities
- **Priority**: Medium - system functional, optimizations can be applied incrementally

## Deployment Readiness
