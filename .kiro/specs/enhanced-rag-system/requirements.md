# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for an enhanced AI education platform with improved RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) capabilities. The system will allow educators and students to upload PDF documents and interact with AI chatbots that can reference these documents to provide contextual, accurate responses. The platform builds upon existing educational features while significantly improving document processing, storage, and retrieval capabilities.

**Updated with Latest Supabase MCP Capabilities (2025-01-11):**
- Supabase MCP Server provides comprehensive database management tools
- Available tools include: database operations, migrations, Edge Functions, branching, logging, and monitoring
- MCP enables direct database schema management, SQL execution, and real-time monitoring
- Supports both read-only and full-access modes for security flexibility

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Enhanced PDF Upload and Processing

**User Story:** As an educator, I want to upload multiple PDF documents to create a knowledge base, so that students can ask questions and receive answers based on the uploaded content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a PDF file THEN the system SHALL validate the file format and size (max 50MB)
2. WHEN a PDF is uploaded THEN the system SHALL extract text content and create searchable chunks
3. WHEN text extraction is complete THEN the system SHALL generate vector embeddings for semantic search
4. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL store document metadata and provide upload status feedback
5. IF a PDF upload fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages and retry options

### Requirement 2: Document Management System

**User Story:** As an educator, I want to manage my uploaded documents with organization features, so that I can maintain a structured knowledge base for different classes or topics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing documents THEN the system SHALL display a list with title, upload date, file size, and processing status
2. WHEN organizing documents THEN the system SHALL allow creation of folders or categories
3. WHEN managing documents THEN the system SHALL provide options to rename, delete, or move documents
4. WHEN searching documents THEN the system SHALL provide text-based search across document titles and content
5. IF a document is referenced in active conversations THEN the system SHALL prevent accidental deletion

### Requirement 3: Advanced RAG Chat Interface

**User Story:** As a student, I want to chat with an AI that can reference uploaded documents, so that I can get accurate answers based on course materials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN asking a question THEN the system SHALL search relevant document chunks using vector similarity
2. WHEN providing answers THEN the system SHALL cite specific documents and page numbers when possible
3. WHEN no relevant content is found THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate the response is based on general knowledge
4. WHEN multiple documents are relevant THEN the system SHALL synthesize information from multiple sources
5. IF document content conflicts THEN the system SHALL acknowledge different perspectives and sources

### Requirement 4: Real-time Document Processing Status

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the processing status of uploaded documents in real-time, so that I know when documents are ready for use in conversations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a document is uploaded THEN the system SHALL display a progress indicator
2. WHEN processing stages change THEN the system SHALL update status in real-time
3. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL notify the user and enable document use
4. WHEN processing fails THEN the system SHALL display error details and suggested actions
5. IF processing takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL provide estimated completion time

### Requirement 5: Multi-language Document Support

**User Story:** As an educator in a multilingual environment, I want to upload documents in different languages, so that I can support diverse student populations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN uploading documents THEN the system SHALL detect document language automatically
2. WHEN processing multilingual content THEN the system SHALL maintain language-specific embeddings
3. WHEN searching content THEN the system SHALL support cross-language queries where appropriate
4. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL indicate the source language of referenced content
5. IF language detection fails THEN the system SHALL allow manual language specification

### Requirement 6: Document Access Control

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to control which documents are accessible to different classes or student groups, so that I can maintain appropriate content boundaries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN uploading documents THEN the system SHALL allow assignment to specific classes or groups
2. WHEN students access chat THEN the system SHALL only search documents they have permission to access
3. WHEN managing permissions THEN the system SHALL provide bulk assignment options
4. WHEN permissions change THEN the system SHALL update access immediately
5. IF unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL log the attempt and deny access

### Requirement 7: Enhanced Chat History and Context

**User Story:** As a student, I want my chat history to maintain context about which documents were referenced, so that I can review and continue previous conversations effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing chat history THEN the system SHALL display document sources for each AI response
2. WHEN continuing conversations THEN the system SHALL maintain context about previously referenced documents
3. WHEN exporting conversations THEN the system SHALL include document citations and references
4. WHEN searching chat history THEN the system SHALL allow filtering by referenced documents
5. IF document content is updated THEN the system SHALL indicate when responses may be outdated

### Requirement 8: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the platform to handle multiple concurrent users and large document collections efficiently, so that performance remains consistent as usage grows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple users upload simultaneously THEN the system SHALL process documents without performance degradation
2. WHEN the document collection grows large THEN the system SHALL maintain fast search response times (< 2 seconds)
3. WHEN many users chat simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent requests efficiently
4. WHEN system resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL prioritize active user requests
5. IF performance thresholds are exceeded THEN the system SHALL implement graceful degradation strategies

### Requirement 9: Analytics and Insights

**User Story:** As an educator, I want to see analytics about how students interact with documents and what topics they ask about most, so that I can improve my teaching materials and methods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN students interact with documents THEN the system SHALL track usage patterns and popular content
2. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide insights on question types and document effectiveness
3. WHEN viewing analytics THEN the system SHALL display data in clear, actionable visualizations
4. WHEN privacy is a concern THEN the system SHALL anonymize student data in reports
5. IF trends are identified THEN the system SHALL highlight areas needing attention or improvement

### Requirement 10: Mobile-Responsive Design

**User Story:** As a student using mobile devices, I want full access to document-based chat functionality, so that I can learn effectively regardless of my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing on mobile THEN the system SHALL provide optimized touch interfaces for all features
2. WHEN uploading documents on mobile THEN the system SHALL support camera capture and file selection
3. WHEN chatting on mobile THEN the system SHALL display document references clearly in limited screen space
4. WHEN viewing document lists on mobile THEN the system SHALL provide efficient navigation and search
